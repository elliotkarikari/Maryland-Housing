# Docs Structure Cleanup Pass 2 (2026-02)

Date: 2026-02-15  
Scope: documentation-only normalization (historical references + archive structure)

## Actions Completed

1. Added canonical docs index: `docs/README.md`
2. Added archive index/policy: `docs/archive/README.md`
3. Marked `docs/PROJECT_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` as historical with canonical replacements
4. Preserved root status snapshot by archiving:
   - `docs/archive/COMPLETE_SYSTEM_STATUS_2026-01-30.md`
5. Converted `docs/COMPLETE_SYSTEM_STATUS.md` into a historical pointer file
6. Clarified `docs/ANALYSIS_METHODS.md` as high-level notes; canonical methods remain in `docs/architecture/ANALYSIS_METHODS.md`
7. Added 2026-02 addendum in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_CHANGELOG.md`

## Outcome

- Current docs vs historical docs are now clearly separated.
- Canonical references are explicit and centralized.
- Historical plans/snapshots remain preserved for provenance.
