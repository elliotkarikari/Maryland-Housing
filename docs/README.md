# Documentation Map

This directory is organized into canonical docs and historical archives.

## Canonical (Current)

- System architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Methodology: `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`
- Layer methods detail: `docs/architecture/ANALYSIS_METHODS.md`
- Data sources registry: `docs/architecture/DATA_SOURCES.md`
- API reference: `docs/api/API_REFERENCE.md`
- Deployment + contributor guides: `docs/development/`
- Layer-specific runbooks: `docs/layers/`
- Monthly audits: `docs/audits/`

## Historical / Archive

- Historical snapshots and superseded plans are kept under `docs/archive/`.
- Archived documents are retained for provenance and should not be treated as current runbooks.

## Notes

- If a document conflicts with the canonical set above, prefer the canonical doc.
- `docs/PROJECT_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` and `docs/COMPLETE_SYSTEM_STATUS.md` are historical pointers.
