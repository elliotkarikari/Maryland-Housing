# Documentation Map

This directory is organized into canonical docs and historical archives.

## Canonical (Current)

- System architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Methodology: `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`
- Layer methods detail: `docs/architecture/ANALYSIS_METHODS.md`
- Data sources registry: `docs/architecture/DATA_SOURCES.md`
- API reference: `docs/api/API_REFERENCE.md`
- Deployment + contributor guides: `docs/development/`
- Layer-specific runbooks: `docs/layers/`
- Monthly audits: `docs/audits/`

## Historical / Archive

- Historical snapshots and superseded plans are kept under `docs/archive/`.
- Archived documents are retained for provenance and should not be treated as current runbooks.

## Legacy Path Map (Bit 2)

- `docs/API_IMPLEMENTATION.md` -> `docs/api/API_REFERENCE.md` (archived copy: `docs/archive/legacy/API_IMPLEMENTATION_REDIRECT_2026-02.md`)
- `docs/ANALYSIS_METHODS.md` -> `docs/architecture/ANALYSIS_METHODS.md` (archived copy: `docs/archive/legacy/ANALYSIS_METHODS_HIGH_LEVEL_2026-02.md`)
- `docs/BUGFIXES.md` -> `QUICKSTART.md` for setup + troubleshooting, `docs/audits/` for ongoing fixes (archived copy: `docs/archive/legacy/BUGFIXES_2026-01-28.md`)
- `docs/URBAN_PULSE_IDEA.md` -> archived as future concept in `docs/archive/ideas/URBAN_PULSE_IDEA.md`

## Notes

- If a document conflicts with the canonical set above, prefer the canonical doc.
- `docs/PROJECT_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` and `docs/COMPLETE_SYSTEM_STATUS.md` are historical pointers.
